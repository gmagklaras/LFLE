The Linux Forensic Logging Environment is a set of tools whose purpose is to provide comprehensive user, process, file access and network endpoint activity data for Linux and Unix based systems. 

The software evolved out of the LUARM logging engine, a research prototype that focused on insider IT misuse mitigation (https://sourceforge.net/projects/luarm/)
