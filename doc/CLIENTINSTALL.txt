Outline of steps to install the LFLE client
###########################################

Step 1: Check Internet connectivity:
Ensure that your LFLE clients have access to the Internet OR a mirror of 
Linux Distro packages and CPAN. 


Step 2: Install the following Perl packages:
-Net::OpenSSH
-Net::SSH::Perl
-Net::SCP
-IO::File
-Time::HiRes

Most Linux distributions will have ready made packages for these Perl modules.
For example, RedHat based distros (Fedora, RHEL, CentOS) could install the modules 
by typing: 

yum -y install perl-Net-OpenSSH perl-Net-SSH perl-Net-SSH-Perl perl-Net-SCP perl-IO-Pty-Easy

Debian/Ubuntu based distros would have equivalent commands via their package managers. 
Distro specific packages are preferred but if that fails, you can always use CPAN 
as your trusted friend:
http://www.cpan.org/


Step 3: Download the LFLE code. Your system should have a commandline git client, so you
can clone the repository. As user root, ensure you make a directory NOT accessible by the
other users of the system. cd into that directory and git clone the LXFE repo by typing:
git clone https://github.com/gmagklaras/LFLE


Step 4: Register your LFLE client on your LFLE server
You should have the LFLE server running by now. Make sure you write down the IP address of 
your LFLE server. (Public IP or internal LAN,your choice, as SSH/SCP is used for secure data 
transfer). Then cd into the git cloned dir and go into the client subdirectory. 
Run the client registration script:

lucreg.pl --server SERVER_DNS_NAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS --pass PASSWORD
